# Data-Structure-Learning
the implemention of data structures in java

Info: try to learn the data structure and apply to normal algorithm with java.  
Refer to the book -- **Fundamentals of Data Structure in C**
  
## Chapter 1
Attention: the most important thing, in this chapter, is the difference between iteration and recursive.  
1. Selection sort  
2. Binary search: iteration and recursive  
3. Permutation  
4. **Magic square**  

## Chapter 2
Attention: in this chapter, how to define ADT and how to realise it by java will be learned. Especially, I just accomplish  
the ADT of sparse polynomial and sparse matrix by array list. Then I will give the method, by linked list, to finish them  
in the next chapter. Finally, pattern matching algorithm for string will be introduced.
1. Sparse polynomial  
2. Sparse matrix  
3. Pattern Matching & KMP pattern matching algorithm  

## Chapter 3  
Attention: in this chapter, to learn the ADT of stack and queue, and using array list to accomplish them.
1. Stack  
2. Queue & Circular queue  
3. **the problem of maze**

## Chapter 4  
Attention: in this chapter, to introduce the linked list, and to re-accomplish stack, queue, polynomial, and matrix by linked
list. In addition, learning to use inner class to construct node class.
1. linked natural number  
2. dynamic linked stack  
3. dynamic linked queue  
4. linked polynomial  
5. linked-list's utility & circular-list's utility
